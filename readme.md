## Playlist Merge for Rdio

http://playlistmerge.appspot.com

#About
Playlist merge helps you combine two or more Rdio playlists into a new playlist.

It uses an awesome open font: http://openfontlibrary.org/face/press-start-2p

Because it copies the chosen playlists together, there is no risk of losing or altering your original playlists.
